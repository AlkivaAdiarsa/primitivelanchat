# Primitive LAN chat made using python
[How to use](#how-to-use) | [How It works](#how-it-works) 

libraries used:
```python
import socket
import threading
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog, scrolledtext, messagebox
```

## How to use
after opening the program, it will show two windows

<img width="332" height="178" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2834baa7-b927-4a11-b8c8-2605eae6b8fb" />

the big window is the main application, used to send and recieve the messages
the small one is for setting up the application.
to start, click the small dialogbox. 
type ```server``` to setup your device as a server, or type ```client < server ip address>```, for example ```client 123.456.78.90```.
to be a ```client```, you have to get your server's ip address
